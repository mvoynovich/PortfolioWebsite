# Home webpage for ITWS Class

Updated index.html to be home webpage
Created a projects.html to store all projects
Linked all labs to the web page through the projects tab
Need to manually add new projects and menu options on the side, but left templates in comments for easy changes
Will probably eventually change it to have it automatically update
Decided on side bar instead of menu on top 
Single Web Page resume file is linked on the project, the resume with sidebar and formatting with website is linked on the sidebar menu
Will add more areas like featured projects as things come up like the potential xhtml article stuff
Used sidebar across all pages to navigate
